For this assignment, I didn't meet the requirement. I had hard time understanding 
on creating table using javascript as well as some error messages I couldn't figure out the causes. In this assignment, users were asked for valid inputs
and based the inputs, a mulipication was created using javascript. Understanding Javascript was main goal
for this assignment.
